<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi There ( ^_^)／</h2>
<h3>Thank You for visiting my website!<br/>

  I’m Khyati and I am excited to share my ongoing journey with you- filled with curiosity to learn and develop new skills, mixed with creativity and innovation.</h3>

<p>As a graduate of the Business Management and Entrepreneurship program at Algonquin College, I had the opportunity to learn about the intricacies of Client Experience, Selling, Marketing, Project management to delving into Finance and Accounting. <br/>

  My current role is all about listening to user problems and issues and helping them find solutions as a customer support representative. It’s all about understanding client needs, ensuring satisfaction, and enhancing the overall experience.<br/>
  
  <p>Previously, as a Quality Coach & Learning Ambassador at Amazon, I delved into achieving quality metrics and ensuring seamless processes. Throughout three quarters, I maintained the DPMO (Defects made per million opportunities) metrics under the threshold. It wasn’t just about crunching numbers. It involved gathering insights and working with the amazing team to foster a culture of excellence.</p>
  
  <p>I had the opportunity to hone my sales prowess at Colio Estate Wines working as a Sales Associate.</p>
