<h2>Best of the best of all time (Maybe not)</h2>

<h3> Oppenheimer:- 7/10</h3>
<p> I'll be honest, It wasn't the best movie out there, but definitely wasn't the worst. Personally, for my taste, I would have appreciated more
    science concepts included in the movie.
</p>
<h3>OMG 2:- 6/10</h3>
<p> Kind of follows the same narrative as OMG 1. Tackling a thought provoking issue and centering the movie around that particular topic </p>

<h3>Barbie:- 7/10</h3>
<p>Margot Robbie is just phenomenol. So pretty. Apart from that, Ken got to tell his side of the story as well. Nicely layed out when it comes to potraying reality of growing up as a child into an adult...playing with toys(Barbie). Leaving them behinh as we grow up, justb keepingt the memories with ourself. </p>
