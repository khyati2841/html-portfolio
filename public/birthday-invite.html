<h3>What to bring:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Starving Stomach (There is no food, but we can always play hunger games...just kidding, please be calm and on normal human behaviour) </li>
    <li> A nice gift for me (Ain't no one celebrating birthday, without the presents...handmade cards are the best, if we are being fancy maybe, origami flowers )</li>
    <li>Mood to party, dance and have fun</li>
</ul>
